through Universal Communication Method", which proposes a universal communication 
method UniComm between agents.

# Usage

We use [CityFlow](https://github.com/zyr17/CityFlow) as traffic simulator. Note
it is a forked version of the original CityFlow, which added some functions to 
calculate some statistics in C++ instead of Python, also in this version we
re-implement the calculation method of average travel time, which is more
precise than the original CityFlow, considering the time passing intersections
and the very last lane for vehicles. As the result, average travel time 
reported by this version is longer than the original version, and we do not 
recommend comparing the results with the results from original Cityflow directly.

We suggest using Docker to run our code. Use the docker image: `zyr17/unlight`.
Alternatively, you can build an environment by your self. We run our codes on
Python 3.6.5, it should also work on higher version of Python, but the 
compatibility is not guaranteed. 

## Docker

```bash
git clone git@github.com:zyr17/UniLight.git
cd UniLight && tar zxf data.tgz
docker run -it --rm -v `pwd`:/code zyr17/unilight

# in docker
cd /code
```

## Build
```bash
git clone git@github.com:zyr17/CityFlow.git
cd CityFlow && pip install . --upgrade && cd ..
git clone git@github.com:zyr17/UniLight.git
cd UniLight && tar zxf data.tgz && pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run

For training:
```bash
python main.py --config configs/main/UniLight.yml --cityflow-config configs/cityflow/SH1.yml
```
For testing:
```bash
python main.py --config configs/main/UniLight.yml --cityflow-config configs/cityflow/SH1.yml --preload-model-file ${PATH_TO_MODEL_PT} --test-round 10
```

# Details

## Environment

The definition of environment is in `envs/CityFlowEnv.py`. It runs in another 
process managed by `envs/SubProcVecEnv.py`.

## Dataset

You can find the newly proposed datasets in `data/SH1` and `data/SH2`, as well
as three commonly used `JN` `HZ` and `NY` after extracting the `data.tgz` 
tarball.

## Agents

The agents and communication mainly defined in `rl/agents/NewModelAgent.py`,
which is wrapped by `rl/multiAgents/NewModelMultiAgent.py`, and its `nn.Module`
is defined in `rl/models/innerModels/NewModel.py`. 

## Arguments and Configs

We parse arguments by `utils/argument.py`. The config for CityFlow and main
process are two separate configs. All CityFlow configs are stored in 
`configs/cityflow`, and `configs/main` for main configs.

## Logs

When training starts, all logs will save in `logs/${TARGET}` folder, including
full logs, configs, CityFlow replay files, and saved models. The
target foler name is start with current time. There are two exceptions, 
output of TensorBoard is in `runs`, and output of wandb is in `wandb`.
